# 🚀 FreeCodeCamp Daily Coding Challenge

I solve one coding problem every day (mostly from FreeCodeCamp).  
This repo contains my daily practice solutions, grouped **week by week** for each month.

## 📂 Structure

- Each month has a folder (`september-2025`, `october-2025`, etc.)
- Inside each month → `week-1.js`, `week-2.js`, etc.
- Each file contains 7 problems (one week’s solutions).

## ✅ Solved Problems

### September 2025

- [Week 4](./september-2025/week-4.js) → Longest Word, Phone Number Formatter etc.

### October 2025

- [Week 1](./october-2025/week-1.js) → Binary to Decimal, etc.
